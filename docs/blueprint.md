## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Deep black (#121212) to provide a modern and sophisticated backdrop, echoing the request for a dark theme.
- Primary color: Emerald green (#3CB371) used for primary interactive elements such as call to actions and for keyboard focus states. Green highlights Sedge Enterprises branding.
- Accent color: Muted light green (#8FBC8F) used for badges and background elements to provide subtle contrast, analogous to emerald green and maintaining the branding color identity.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, providing a tech-forward, readable aesthetic.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, ensuring a modern and readable text.
- Simple, outline-style icons in a light color (desaturated from primary) to represent the steps in the 'How It Works' section.
- Responsive grid container with a max width of 1240px to ensure content is well-spaced on larger screens, and scales down effectively on smaller devices.
- Subtle fade/slide reveals and transform hovers to create smooth and engaging micro-interactions, adding a layer of visual polish without overwhelming the user.
